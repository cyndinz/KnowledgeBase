An understanding of economic theory and decision-making principles is essential for analysing the complex relationships between businesses, markets, and society. Core economic theories and principles provide a foundation for explaining how businesses interact with the environment, other companies, customers, and employees. Economics plays a central role in shaping business strategies and societal outcomes, contributing to the development of global value chains. By applying economic principles, it becomes possible to generate effective solutions to complex business problems and critically analyse real-world decisions. This approach also encourages ethical awareness, highlighting the broader social impacts of economic thinking and promoting responsible decision-making.

# Principles of Accounting and Finance
A solid understanding of accounting and finance is essential for effective financial and management decision-making. Key concepts include identifying the information needs, uses, and sources relevant to various stakeholders involved in decision-making processes. Techniques such as cost-volume-profit analysis are used to evaluate operating decisions, while investment appraisal methods support the assessment of potential business investments. Knowledge of both long-term and short-term funding sources is important for making informed financing decisions. Additionally, understanding the purpose and structure of the three main financial statements—income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement—enables meaningful analysis to guide strategic business choices.
